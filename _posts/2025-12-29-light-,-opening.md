I learned late what it means to be in the world. Silence was natural, and when I opened my mouth, I didn’t quite know what to do. I still don’t. While I needed to understand how to use my voice, I sought the fluidity that could keep up with my thoughts and feelings from a pen or a keyboard. 

Before I learned what it meant to be in the world, I was filled with desire to be erased from it. Or perhaps it was simply curiosity about death itself. When my mother delicately pieced together and read the absolutely fictional suicide note I had torn into dozens of pieces and thrown away, I don’t remember if I remembered why I had imagined someone wanting to die. I still don’t really know.

Our kitchen got quite a lot light. Huge windows, a balcony that still felt open to the outside even though it had been closed off later, and bright green marble that reflected the light well. There was nothing in front of the building to block the sun, but it wasn’t bright at that moment. I remember anger rather than worry. I shouldn’t have written such things again. As my mother’s shadow fell over me, I accepted that the sun’s presence also brought darkness. To write what I wanted and not see death as a reality outside of life, a computer seemed safer than a pen. Anything my mother wouldn’t touch could have been used, really. 

As I wrote, I sensed the existence of another possibility; it’s not just about hiding or revealing myself. How does a human being come to be? It’s easy to steal Heidegger’s answer, and frankly, it feels right: Care. I had to care, but learning to care when no one cared was challenging. 

The quiet hours of my quiet childhood could only be described as such from the outside. Perhaps to my mother and father, I was a calm child who spent all day doing jigsaw puzzles, but the stillness of the day was also mine to observe. Noticing the things that mattered to people, trying to discern the changes in their tone of voice or their expressions. I knew which tickets to hide for the day we would leave, or where to put my father’s car keys so he wouldn’t go to work.  

This absurd passive-aggressive phase didn’t last long; once people realize what mischief you’re up to, the fun wears off. Perhaps that’s why I turned to possibilities of creating then. Life itself is all about possibilities, but I wasn’t aware of it, so I thought only a text could give me that. 

If I could learn what it meant to be human by reading, then by writing I was existing in this world as a human being. Amidst the uncertainty and unease of the human experience, yet unable to bear the unwritten, revealing one’s own truth. 

Writing heightens consciousness. But in the digital age, this transformation accelerates and fragments. The computer seemed safer than the pen-not just from my mother's surveillance, but because it promised a new kind of autonomous discourse, one that could be edited, deleted, resurrected. The screen became both mirror and mask, a surface where identity could be composed and decomposed at will. 

We write ourselves into being through these technological mediations, but what remains when the algorithms read us back to ourselves? 

It’s hard to feel anything except when I’m writing. I think Hanif Kureishi said something about writing to ferment the intensity of life; I’m generally more intense on paper than I am in real life. And because I’m usually afraid of this, sitting down to write isn’t easy either. Characters may think differently. They may react in ways you never would, or feel things you cannot. But you are the drop in the lake. Every sentence is a ripple moving outward from you. However far the circles spread, they still carry your mark. Alienation is impossible. 

I’m often unsure whether it’s better to freeze something or record its movement. Even my earliest memories are sometimes frozen. Yet, I know that even a still image is subject to a movement. Since the relationship between the human mind and an image (whether in our minds, on a screen, or on printed paper) fundamentally memory-based and somewhat dependent on the context of the present, no image remains suspended in the moment it is captured. Just as no word remains fixed in the text where it is written. As every word is connected to life and, naturally, to death, it cannot have a side that does not move towards the future. 

<p style="text-align: right;">“Différance is what makes the movement of signification possible only if each element that is said to be ‘present,’ appearing on the stage of presence, is related to something other than itself but retains the mark of a past element and already lets itself be hollowed out by the mark of its relation to a future element.” 

Jacques Derrida</p>

Figuring out this potential also opened my world to creating. My previous word could be something completely different, my next sentence could take the narrative to a place I couldn’t predict. It seemed that this was the way to differentiate the text.

But what happens when the AI completes our sentences? The question haunts me differently now as someone who learned to exist through writing. If I outsource the construction of sentences to a machine trained on million of texts, including, perhaps, my own, do I lose an essential part of writing? The ability to eliminate inconsistencies, to choose between words with reflective selectivity? 

It’s clear that I’ll never be a true plotter. Experiencing what writing can do to the chains of thought feels more infinite than going to a chosen, illuminated point. 
Light is both a necessity and a huge prohibition.

But it wasn’t just about the text. It’s also a way to differentiate yourself. It’s “opening of a world”.

I have some photographs where light seeps into the film. If we asked a technician, they would interpret it as nothing more than a mistake, but I want to treat the presence of light, which seeps in and could be said to ruin part of the photograph, as a break in space and time, another narrative possibility, taking refuge in the wildness of the ancient human mind’s desire to give meaning to all their observations of nature and to create stories. 

Writing, real writing, not the production of text forces us living with mysteries rather than treating everything as data to be processed. 

Life is not just an indivisible chain of cause and effect. I am at peace with not remembering my childhood vividly. There are moments when light flows into my memory, but they are either too far away or too close to make sense of. Still, there will always be spaces where two images come one after the other, creating new connections in my mind. The non-linearity of the narrative never made what was told meaningless. 

Writing gives me that right distance. Only by writing can I realize how to look at things. And perhaps this is the deeper anxiety about AI-generated text: not that machines can write, but that they offer us a way to avoid looking. 

We need intelligence and wisdom, Coeckelbergh says but wisdom cannot be delegated to machines. It emerges from concrete engagement with the material world, with other beings, with the fact of our own finitude. The truth of being connected to everything is as present as the randomness of existence’s thrownness. I suppose knowing this truth allows me to let go of the world’s inherent meaningless. After all, if it doesn’t matter, you can always care. For the world. For yourself. And because it’s the part of the world and the concept of being in the world, also, for the death, without which no possibility or toward-futureness is possible. 

Then perhaps I can now fit my turning towards death, even when I had only just learnt to read and write, into a framework. Not because frameworks are necessary, but because it is pleasant to spend the time we kill giving meaning to things. Perhaps also because believing that one is close to understanding one’s true self is not such a bad feeling after all.
