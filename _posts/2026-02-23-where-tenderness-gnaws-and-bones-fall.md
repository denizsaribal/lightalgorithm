I heard his faint voice weaving through the swarm of thoughts that pressed against the emptiness before me. He was calling me from behind a door, where light gently crept in. I was always called, and I always obeyed, whether I wanted to or not.

I moved through the thoughts that lingered in the void, entering the bathroom where the white light seared my eyes. I didn’t speak. He didn’t speak. He made me sit on the small stool placed before the mirror. His hands on my shoulders made me want to run. But I didn’t.

In his hand, a toothbrush, with a small dab of paste. He lifted my chin slightly, waiting for me to show my teeth. He granted me a few precious moments, fitting for the silence of the entire day.

No tooth is ever cleaned with such tenderness, but that was not our concern.

I remember a day we walked together. Perhaps there was a distance between us, one our steps could never close. Not every place he called me to was meant to dazzle me, and when he looked at me through a camera, I felt safer. He looked the way he looked at trees, or at a leaf touched by light. At the blue of any sky, carrying the kind of admiration one might feel for Renoir’s blue—as if the feeling evoked by Renoir had settled into that very moment of looking. Careful, holding his feelings in the space between his finger and the shutter.

None of the photographs he took ever shouted in anger, and no place where his words refused to reach me ever dazzled my eyes. Let the sun, if it must, strike me with its harshest rays reflected off the river beside us; still, I would celebrate only the silence that belongs to humans. The sounds our more-animal-than-us bodies failed to suppress belonged elsewhere. It was in that immanence I existed, and it was through his gaze from behind the viewfinder that I was in the world.

Now, as I feel the oval movements of the brush in my bones and listen to the wind passing through the vent into the bathroom, I am something brittle, as if about to fracture and disappear.

I don’t know if he could hear it, too, but he never seemed like he would break. While he draped his soul in the guise of a monster, I became a wind, soothing everything. We were like this when we walked the paths that people once walked and forgot. We felt the rhythm of nature within us, and there, we drew closer to each creature than we did to each other. Only in that stillness, only in the harmony of the most natural sounds, could we glide together.
And only then could I feel, even if no one would follow the traces I left behind, the essence they once granted to each stone, each piece of earth, and to the beams of light that filtered through the trees.

Now, I fixed my gaze on the bathroom’s white light. The call of my body shifting from tenderness to restlessness. I waited for it to end. The hum of the electricity, the friction of the toothbrush, and the thoughts I had let drift into the room. Above all, the emotions. Most of all, those that drifted away from him.

The white light, scattering black spots in my eyes, didn’t break me. He pulled the toothbrush from my mouth and stepped back. In the small space he created, I spat all my teeth into the sink. 

I suppose they didn't fit in my mouth. But I took the blow of emptiness, thinking I would be free from the pain that permeated all my bones. Everything that came out of my mouth began to be stained with blood, viciously, instead.

I didn’t look at him. I watched the water instead, carrying away what it could, slowing where it always slows. Nothing here was dramatic. Nothing announced itself. The sink held. The pipes did their work. Somewhere outside, the light kept falling on leaves that would outlast this room, or not.
I thought, briefly, about how much of the world depends on things being carried elsewhere. How often we trust disappearance to mean resolution. 

When I finally stood up, my mouth felt unfamiliar, lighter and heavier at once. I followed my own footsteps out of the room, knowing they would fade quickly, knowing the floor would not remember me for long. Still, I walked.

Somewhere between what is taken and what remains, something continues.
